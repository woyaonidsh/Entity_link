## Introduction  
The project is mainly about entity link technology. The input of the task is a piece of text and the corresponding entity, and the output is the related entity set of the entity in the entity database. I use a two-tower and hierarchical neural network to solve this problem

## Model
The model consists of entity-encoder and mention-encoder. Entity-encoder is used to model entity and description of entity. Mention-encoder is used to model mention and
context of mention. Specially, I split context into left context and right context so that this model can capture more information about mention.
